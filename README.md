**Important Note:
You must have the Lunar Crater .TIF files installed and located in the same directory as the above AL trial code when running a trial (find all Lunar Crater .TIF files here: https://github.com/xfyna/AL-BNN-GP.git)

In order to run any trials, ensure the following system arguments are entered:

[1] Surface Type ("Parabola", "Lunar", "Townsend")

[2] Trial Name (i.e., a number, letter, etc. that will be appended to the newly created trial folder)
